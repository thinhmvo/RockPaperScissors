# Rock Paper Scissors Game

In this project, I created a rock-paper-scissors game in JavaScript and displayed the results using the console.

## User Guide:

- Enter the number of rounds you prefer when prompted.
- Input your selection when prompted.

## Developer's Note:

- I used a switch statement to evaluate the conditions between the computer's answer and the user's answer.
- Then, I displayed the game result in the console.
- I implemented the continuity of the game using a for loop.

## What I've Learned:

Through this project, I became familiar with JavaScript and created a basic rock-paper-scissors game that continuously plays using loops. It's very cool!

I learned how to use conditional logic and print things out to the console, as well as using the developer tools in browsers to debug my program.

### This project was created about 5 months before I took the leap of faith to join the Tech Elevator bootcamp and accelerate my programming skills to become a software developer.
